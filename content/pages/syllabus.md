Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Calculus of Several Variables (18.02) and Differential Equations (18.03) or Honors Differential Equations (18.034)

Course Outline
--------------

This course has four major topics:

*   Applied linear algebra (so important!)
*   Applied differential equations (for engineering and science)
*   Fourier methods
*   Algorithms (lu, qr, eig, svd, finite differences, finite elements, FFT)

My Goals for the Course
-----------------------

I hope you will feel that this is the most useful math course you have ever taken. I will do everything I can to make it so. This will not be like a calculus class where a method is explained and you just repeat it on homework and a test. The goals are to see the underlying pattern in so many important applications—and fast ways to compute solutions.

Assignments and Exams
---------------------

This course has ten problem sets, three one-hour exams, and no final exam. You may use your textbook and notes on the exams.

Grades
------

Let me try to say this clearly: my life is in teaching, to help you learn. Grades have come out properly for 20 years (almost all A-B). I will NOT spend the semester thinking about grades. I hope you don't either. The homeworks will be important and I plan 3 exams and no final. Those exams are open book and a chance for you to bring key ideas together.

Text

The textbook for this course is:

Strang, Gilbert. _Computational Science and Engineering_. Wellesley, MA: [Wellesley-Cambridge Press](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/), 2007. ISBN: 9780961408817. ([Table of Contents](http://www-math.mit.edu/cse/#toc))

Information about this book can be found at the Wellesley-Cambridge Press Web site, along with a link to Prof. Strang's new "[Computational Science and Engineering](http://www-math.mit.edu/cse/)" Web page developed as a resource for everyone learning and doing Computational Science and Engineering.
